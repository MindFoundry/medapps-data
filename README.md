# Mind Foundry Geospatial Data for EV Chargers
This repository collects a number of scripts for gathering and preparing geospatial data for use with Mind Foundry's Electric Vehicle (EV) charger optimization platform. In each case the data covers the whole of Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales).

The majority of the data are not included directly in this repository but is instead downloaded from the original source and further processed by the scripts. In each case a link to further information about the source dataset is given along with information about its licence terms. Any use of the source data or derived data generated by the code in this repository is subject to the relevant licence agreement for the source data.

In some cases where automated download is non-trivial, the datasets have been included directly in this repository. In these cases the licences are also reproduced in the repo and links to the original download location are provided.



## Setup Guide
* Install python (>= 3.9.7)
* Create a python venv (see [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))
  * e.g., `python -m venv ./.venv`
* Activate virtual environment
  * e.g., `source ./.venv/bin/activate` (linux)
* Install python libraries
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
* Use DVC to run all data pipelines and regenerate data (This may take several hours)
  * `dvc repro -R .` 
  * Alternatively, `cd` into one of the `workflow` subdirectories and run the same command from there. This will just run that specific pipeline (and any dependencies).


## Datasets
### County Boundaries (`boundaries`)
Bounding polygons for the administrative and ceremonial counties.

County boundary data are derived from OpenStreetMap (see [license](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)).

### LSOA Boundaries (`boundaries-lsoa`)
Bounding polygons for lower layer super output areas. LSOAs are standardised areas developed for the census but used for reporting a lot of statistical data. LSOAs have an average population of 1500 and cover an average of 650 households.

LSOA boundary data are provided by the [Office for National Statistics](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::lower-layer-super-output-areas-december-2011-boundaries-generalised-clipped-bgc-ew-v3/about) 

### Postcode District Boundaries (`boundaries-postcode-district`)
Bounding polygons for postcode districts (e.g., BB3, BB4, etc.)

Postcode district boundary data are taken from [doogal.co.uk](https://www.doogal.co.uk/PostcodeDownloads.php). No explicit licence information is listed.


### Bus Stops and Bus Stations (`bus-stops-stations`)
Locations of bus stops and bounding polygons for bus stations.

Bus stop data are derived from OpenStreetMap (see [license](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)).


### Car Parks (`car-parks`)
Locations (bounding polygons) for car parks and additional attributes including capacity, fee, etc.

Car park data are derived from OpenStreetMap (see [license](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)).


### EV Charge Points (`charge-points`)
Locations of publicly accessible electric vehicle charge points with additional attributes including charger speed.

EV charge point data are derived from the National Chargepoint Registry (NCR). This data are available under the [OGL Licence v3](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).


### Demographics (`demographics`)
Demographic data are derived from the multiple indices of deprivation, published separately by each of the governments of England, Scotland and Wales. The data are broken down by LSOA and details the relative level of deprivation of each area with respect to a number of indicators - wealth, health, education, and crime, as well as an overall score. The data are presented in terms of deciles for each, with 1 being the most deprived and 10 the least deprived.

These data are available from all three governments under the [OGL Licence v3](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).


### High Voltage Electric Grid Infrastructure (`dnos`)
Locations and available capacity information for the primary substations in the national high voltage electric grid. This is derived from data provided by the distribution network operators (DNOs). A total of 6 separate DNOs operate across Britain but data are only made publicly available for 2 of them: UK Power Networks (UKPN) and Western Power Distribution (WPD). We have combined the datasets from these 2 DNOs into a unified format.

Data from UKPN is available under a [CC BY 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Data from WPD is available under the [WPD Open Data Licence](https://www.westernpower.co.uk/open-data-licence) (which is based on the OGL v3.0 licence).


### Electric Vehicle Registrations (`ev-registrations`)
Counts of the total number of registered Ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs), broken down by postcode district (e.g., OX1). ULEVs includes both fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

EV Registration data are provided by the UK Department for Transport and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. This data are available under the [OGL Licence v3](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).


### Roads and Buildings (`land-use`)
Road data are provided in the form of lines with some extra information such as name and road number. Building data are provided in teh form of polygons.

Both roads and buildings data are derived from the Ordnance Survey OpenMap Local product which is available under the [OGL Licence v3](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).
